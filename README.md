# Camptix - Workshop Booking System

Adds a Workshop Booking System into Camptix, so that WordCamp attendees can book a seat.

## Features

* Compatible with multi-ticket sales.
* Set the number of seats each attendee can book.
* Booking confirmation before the event.

## Build Process

Requirements:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v8.9.1 or later.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) v5.5.1 or later.

To compile and generate the build files just execute the following command on your terminal:

```
npm run start
